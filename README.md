# Improved_Movement_Unity_First_Person_Template
<p>
Improved the movement of the original unity first person template with extra features
<br>
This only extends the original scripts of the template and was made with beginners in mind
<br>
Feel free to clone it or fork it and do whatever you want with it
</p>
<br>
Changes:
<ul>
  <li>Added a jump buffer and coyote time to the movement</li>  
  <li>Now has the ability to have variable jump height</li>  
  <li>When not moving anymore, the player has controllable deceleration instead of instantly stopping</li>  
  <li>The jump deceleration can also be controlled for the variable jump height</li>  
  <li>Apex gravity is applied to fall faster to remove the feeling of floatiness</li>
</ul>
